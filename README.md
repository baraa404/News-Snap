## Tech Stack

- Flutter 3.x, Dart (SDK ^3.8.1)
- Packages: dio, cached_network_image, webview_flutter, url_launcher, google_fonts

## Architecture

- `lib/services/` ‚Äî API services (NewsAPI integration via `NewsApiService`)
- `lib/modules/` ‚Äî Data models (`ArticleModel`, `FullArticelsModel`)
- `lib/screens/` ‚Äî UI screens and views
- `lib/widgets/` ‚Äî Reusable components (e.g., animated tabs, swipeable stack)

Data flow:

1. `NewsApiService` fetches JSON using dio
2. Responses are parsed into models
3. Screens render lists/cards and open details in a WebView

## Custom Widgets

This project includes two powerful custom widgets that you can easily reuse in your own Flutter projects:

### üéØ AnimatedTabSelector

A smooth, customizable tab selector with animated transitions between tabs.

**Features:**
- Smooth animated circle indicator
- Fully customizable colors, sizes, and animations
- Support for any number of tabs with icons
- Configurable animation duration and curves

**Usage:**
```dart
AnimatedTabSelector(
  icons: [Icons.home, Icons.search, Icons.settings],
  onTabSelected: (index) => print('Selected tab: $index'),
  backgroundColor: Colors.grey,
  circleColor: Colors.white,
  selectedIconColor: Colors.black,
  animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
)
```

### üÉè SwipeableStack

An interactive card stack widget with smooth swipe animations, perfect for card-based interfaces.

**Features:**
- Swipe cards left/right with gesture detection
- Smooth throw animations with physics
- Configurable stack offset and rotation
- Auto-advances to next card on swipe
- Infinite loop through card collection

**Usage:**
```dart
SwipeableStack(
  children: [
    Card(child: Text('Card 1')),
    Card(child: Text('Card 2')),
    Card(child: Text('Card 3')),
  ],
  animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
  stackOffset: Offset(60, 25),
  rotationAngle: 0.11,
)
```

Both widgets are production-ready and can be extracted into your own projects by copying the files from `lib/widgets/`.
